                <p>I am Hyacinth Okoro from Imo state, Nigeria. I live in Awka, Anambra state with
                    my family of three and we are all members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
                    I am 37 years old and I enjoy travelling, networking and interacting with others.
                    I have always been fascinated about how people write instructions to computers
                    and have their instructions executed to produce their desired outcome, this
                    makes me extremely happy to have this opportunity to learn web development.
                    When I am done with the course, I hope to have become very profficient in 
                    developing very good and effective web pages.</p>
